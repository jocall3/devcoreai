# A Quick Note on Your First Sign-In

Here's a simple breakdown of this one-time process:

1.  **Your First Login:** When you first arrive, our application doesn't have permission to save any data on your computer (in your browser's "local storage"). Your first sign-in is temporary, just to get you into the main app.

2.  **Asking for Permission:** Right after you log in, we ask for your consent to store data locally. We need this permission to remember you for your next visit, so you don't have to sign in every time.

3.  **A Quick Refresh:** When you click "Accept," we save your permission and then the application reloads. This is an important step to make sure the whole app starts up with your new privacy setting active from the very beginning.

4.  **One Last Sign-In:** After the reload, the app now has permission to save your login. However, because nothing was saved *before* the reload, it doesn't remember your first login. So, it asks you to sign in one last time.

### The Good News

This time, your login **is** saved! From now on, you'll be able to access the app directly without needing to sign in again.

Thank you for your understanding. We believe in being transparent and putting your privacy first.
