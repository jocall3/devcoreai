# DevCore AI Toolkit

DevCore is a developer-centric web application designed to showcase the power of AI in the development process. It's a static application that can be deployed to any modern hosting provider.

## Key Features

- **Purely Static**: Runs entirely in the browser with no server backend required.
- **Easy Deployment**: Deploy to any static hosting provider like Hugging Face Spaces, Vercel, or Netlify.
- **AI Feature Builder**: Describe a new UI component, and the AI will generate the TSX/JSX code, unit tests, and a conventional commit message.
- **AI Code Explainer**: Paste any code snippet and get a detailed, easy-to-understand explanation and a visual flowchart generated by Gemini.
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Includes a RegEx Sandbox, Snippet Vault, Code Migrator, and dozens of other AI-powered and simulated developer tools.

## Local Development Setup

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

1.  **Clone the repository.**

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your local environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your Gemini API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

This is a static web application that calls the Gemini API directly from the client. To deploy it, you need to:

1.  **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This creates a `web` directory with your static app.

2.  **Set Environment Variable**:
    Your hosting provider (like Hugging Face Spaces, Vercel, Netlify, etc.) needs to have the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable set during the build process.
    - **Name**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
    - **Value**: Your actual Gemini API key.

3.  **Deploy**:
    Deploy the contents of the `web` directory as a static site. Ensure your hosting provider's build command is `npm run build`.
